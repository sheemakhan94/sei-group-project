  description: 'See new work by Sean Scully inspired by the National Gallery Collection and Joseph Mallord William Turner’s ‘The Evening Star’. In this new work Irish-born, American-based Scully (born 1945) takes Turner’s atmospheric landscape as his starting point. A boy on the shore sets off for home as the sky and sea darken. For Scully, this melancholic picture is one of Turner’s most profound works, to which he feels a deep connection. The exhibition charts Scully’s personal journey of deep admiration for colour, composition, and the power of painting.',

  description: 'In Eliasson’s captivating installations you become aware of your senses, people around you and the world beyond. Some artworks introduce natural phenomena such as rainbows to the gallery space. Others use reflections and shadows to play with the way we perceive and interact with the world. Many works result from the artist’s research into complex geometry, motion patterns, and his interest in colour theory. All but one of the works have never been seen in the UK before. The kitchen team at Studio Olafur Eliasson will also create a special menu and programme of related events for Tate Modern’s Terrace Bar, based on the organic, vegetarian and locally sourced food served in his Berlin studio.',
